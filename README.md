# API for managing JSON objects specified in JSON-LD

This repository contains code fragments for building an API using Node.js and a NoSQL database, and connecting it to an API gateway for authentication and authorization.

## Components

The repository includes the following components:

* `app.js`: A Node.js application that defines the API endpoints and handles the database interactions.
* `package.json`: A file that lists the dependencies required by the Node.js application.
* `Dockerfile`: A file that defines the Docker image for the Node.js application.
* `README.md`: A file that provides an overview of the repository and its components.

## Setup

To run the API, you'll need to perform the following steps:

1. Install Node.js and Docker on your system.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Install the dependencies by running `npm install`.
4. Start the database by running `docker-compose up -d`.
5. Start the API by running `npm start`.

## API Gateway

To secure the API using an API gateway, you can use a service like AWS API Gateway or Google Cloud Endpoints. These services provide authentication and authorization features that you can use to control access to your API.

To configure the API gateway, you'll need to create an API in the gateway service and specify the API endpoints and security settings. You can then update the API endpoint URLs in your Node.js application to point to the API gateway instead of the API itself.

## Conclusion

By following the instructions in this README file, you can build and secure an API using Node.js, a NoSQL database, and an API gateway. Good luck with your project!
